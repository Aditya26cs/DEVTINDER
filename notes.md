Middleware is essential in Express for several reasons:

1 . Code Reusability

Instead of writing authentication, logging, or error handling in every route, middleware allows you to centralize this logic.

2. Security

Middleware can enforce authentication and authorization, such as checking user roles before allowing access.

3 . Error Handling

Special error-handling middleware can catch errors and return appropriate responses without crashing the app.
